### ðŸ”¹ Let's First Learn More About `/usr/local/bin`

<hr>

- ðŸ“Œ What is `/usr/local/bin`?  
`/usr/local/bin` is a directory in Unix-based systems (Linux & macOS) that stores **user-installed executable files** (scripts, binaries, and programs).  

---

- ðŸ“‚ How It Works  
- When you type a command in the terminal, the system searches for an executable in directories listed in the `$PATH` environment variable.  
- `/usr/local/bin` is usually included in `$PATH`, meaning any script or program placed there can be run **without specifying its full path**.  

---

- ðŸ“Œ Why Use `/usr/local/bin`?  
- **Run scripts easily** â†’ You can place your scripts there and call them like built-in commands.  
- **No need for `chmod +x` every time** â†’ Once set up, scripts in `/usr/local/bin` remain executable.  
- **Keeps system directories clean** â†’ Unlike `/bin` or `/usr/bin`, which are managed by the OS, `/usr/local/bin` is intended for user-installed programs.
